Your boss likes to prank you by sending you the sentence he wants to say as a list of words, with each word given as a list of characters. You are already tired of a such low level prank, and decide to write a program that would turn the sentences your boss sends to you into a readable form.

Remember to put a space between two words and put a period in the end of the sentence. Your boss is weird but kind enough not to send you sentences with other punctuation.

Note: if you want an additional challenge, try solving this challenge locally without using STL and C Runtime Library with the only exception being malloc(). Therefore the function you should the implement has the following format:

char* MakeSentence(char* words[])
{
    // function body
}
Example

For

words = [["G","o","o","d"], 
         ["m","o","r","n","i","n","g"]]
the output should be

makeSentence(words) = "Good morning.".

Input/Output

[time limit] 500ms (cpp)
[input] array.array.char words

An array of words, each word is an array of characters.

Constraints:

1 ≤ words.length ≤ 10,

1 ≤ words[i].length ≤ 10.

[output] string

The output sentence after putting all the words together.
