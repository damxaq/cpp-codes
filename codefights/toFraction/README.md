You are given a rational float number n. Return n as an irreducible fraction.

Example

For n = 0.5, the output should be

ToFraction(n) = [1, 2].

0.5 = 5 / 10 = 1 / 2.

Input/Output

[time limit] 500ms (cpp)
[input] float n

Constraints:

0 < n â‰¤ 1000.

[output] array.integer

Array of two elements representing a fraction, where the first element is a numerator, and the second one is the denominator.
