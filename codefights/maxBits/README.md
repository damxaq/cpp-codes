Given an integer n, find the largest positive integer that has the same number of 0s and 1s in its binary representation.

Example

For n = 5, the output should be

maxBits(n) = 6.

5 = 1012, so the answer is 1102 = 6.

For n = 15, the output should be

maxBits(n) = 15.

15 = 11112, so the answer is 11112 = 15.

Input/Output

[time limit] 500ms (cpp)
[input] integer n

Constraints:

0 ≤ n ≤ 1000

[output] integer

An integer that has as many 0s and 1s as n
