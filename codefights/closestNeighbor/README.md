Given a number n, find the largest integer below n and the smallest integer above n that are divisible by a, b, and c.

Example

closestNeighbor(20, 2, 3, 4) = [12, 24]

[time limit] 500ms (cpp)
[input] integer n

A positive integer, 10 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 105.

[input] integer a

[input] integer b
[input] integer c

1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ 100.

[output] array.integer

Array of two integers, the first integer is the largest number less than n and divisible by a, b and c, and the second one is the smallest number greater than n and divisible by a, b ans c.
