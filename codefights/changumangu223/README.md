This problem is similar to one posted not long ago. Here, however, you need to calculate the number of ways to write n as an unordered sum of 2s and 3s.

Example

For n = 8, the output should be:

changumangu223(n) = 2.

There are 2 ways to write 8 as an unordered sum of 2s and/or 3s:

2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8;
2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
Input/Output

[time limit] 500ms (cpp)
[input] integer n

Constraints:

0 ≤ n ≤ 106.

[output] integer

The number of ways to write n as an unordered sum of 2s and/or 3s.
