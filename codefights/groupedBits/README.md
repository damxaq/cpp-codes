Given an integer n, count the number of groups of consecutive 1 bits in its binary representation.

Example

For n = 1259, the output should be

GroupedBits(n) = 4.

The binary representation of 1259 is 10011101011, with the groups in bold.

Input/Output

[time limit] 500ms (cpp)
[input] integer n

Constraints:

0 ≤ n ≤ 109.

[output] integer

The number of groups of 1 bits.
