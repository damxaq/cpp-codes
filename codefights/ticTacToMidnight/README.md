Tic tac, tic tac...

Today, little Chou leaned how to tell the time. He is so proud of it!

As usual, his dad wanted to challenge him and asked the following questions:

"How many minutes are left till midnight?".

Little Chou answered without mistake and his dad was so happy that he gave him a lollipop.

Can you do as well as Little Chou? Unfortunately in your case you will not get any candy, but some well earned CodeFight coins! :o)

Example

For currentTime = "19:00", the output should be

TicTacToMidnight(currentTime) = 300.

There's 5 hours till midnight, which is 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.

TicTacToMidnight("23:59") = 1.

Input/Output

[time limit] 500ms (cpp)
[input] string currentTime

The current time in the format hh:mm. The time is guaranteed to be valid. Midnight is 00:00.

[output] integer

An integer denoting the number of minutes left till midnight.
