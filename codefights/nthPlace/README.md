My daughter was given the following task: given the first number x and the second number y, find the nth number. The description was quite vague, but my daughter managed to do the task.

Can you?

Example

Turns out, for x = 7, y = 10 and n = 5,

the output should be

nthPlace(x, y, n) = 19.

Input/Output

Constraints:

1 ≤ x ≤ y.

[input] integer y

The second number.

Constraints:

x ≤ y ≤ 100.

[input] integer n

The number to find.

Constraints:

3 ≤ n ≤ 50.
