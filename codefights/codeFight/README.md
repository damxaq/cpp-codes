Given a positive integer n, output the string representation of all the numbers from 1 to n inclusive while replacing multiples of 5 with Code, multiples of 7 with Fight and multiples of both 5 and 7 with CodeFight.

Example

For n = 15, the output should be

CodeFight(n) = 
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "3",
    "4",
    "Code",
    "6",
    "Fight",
    "8",
    "9",
    "Code",
    "11",
    "12",
    "13",
    "Fight",
    "Code"
]
