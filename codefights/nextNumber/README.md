You're given a number N. Find the smallest number greater than N which has the same number of active bits in it (i.e. the same number of 1s in its binary representation).

Examples:

For N = 1 the output should be

nextNumber(N) = 2.

Both 1 and 2 have 1 active bit.

For N = 3 the output should be

nextNumber(N) = 5.

Both 3 and 5 have 2 active bits.

Input/Output

[time limit] 500ms (cpp)
[input] integer n

Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 109.

[output] integer

The smallest integer greater than N which has the same number of active bits.
