RPN, or reverse Polish notation, is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. You can find more information about it on this wiki page.

In this challenge your task is to calculate the result of the expression given in reverse Polish notation, which consists of operands and operators, separated by a single whitespace character each.

Possible operators include:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Integer division (/)
Modulus (%)
Exponent (^)
Example

For expression = "5 3 +", the output should be

RPN(expression) = 8.

[time limit] 500ms (cpp)
[input] string expression

A valid expression in reverse Polish notation.

Constraints:

5 â‰¤ expression < 60.

[output] integer

The result after evaluating the given expression.
