Let a number be supereven if all of its digits are even.

Here are the first few supereven positive integers:
2, 4, 6, 8, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 40, ...

Given an integer k, find the kth (1-based) supereven positive integer.

Example

For k = 6, the output should be
supereven(k) = 22.

The 6th supereven positive integer is 22.

Input/Output

[time limit] 500ms (cpp)
[input] integer k

Constraints:
1 ≤ k ≤ 19 · 105.

[output] integer

The kth (1-based) supereven positive integer.
