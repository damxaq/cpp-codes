Not long ago, a new reverse hexadecimal numeral system was introduced. It's very similar to the well-know hexadecimal system, but with a small change. In reverse hexadecimal, 0 stands for 15, 1 stands for 14, and so on, with F for 0.

Given a number in a reverse hexadecimal system, return it in the decimal one.

Example

For revhex = "F", the output should be

reverseHexadecimal(revhex) = 0.
