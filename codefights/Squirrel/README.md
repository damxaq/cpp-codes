Since the weather was still good, some students decided to go for a walk in the park after the first lectures in the new academic year. There they saw a squirrel, who climbed a tree in a spiral at a constant angle to the ground. They calculated that in one loop the squirrel climbes h meters, the height of the tree is equal to H, and the length of its circumference equals S.

These calculations were exhausting, so now the student need your help to figure out how many meters the squirrel climbed when it reached the tree top.

Example:

Squirrel(4,16,3) = 20.0000

[time limit] 500ms (cpp)
[input] integer h

1 ≤ h ≤ 1000

[input] integer H

1 ≤ H ≤ 1000

[input] integer S

1 ≤ S ≤ 1000

[output] float

The answer rounded to 4 decimal places.
